## 🔄 Nodemon – Auto Restart Node.js Server

### ❓ Why We Need `nodemon`?
Every time you change a file in a Node.js project, you need to manually stop and restart the server.  
🔁 `nodemon` automatically restarts your server when file changes are detected — saves time during development!

### ⚙️ How to Install Nodemon?

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
Or as a dev dependency:

bash
Copy code
npm install --save-dev nodemon
🚀 How to Use Nodemon?
Instead of:

bash
Copy code
node app.js
Use:

bash

nodemon app.js
✨ Now your server will auto-restart on any file change!

📌 Bonus Tip (package.json script):
json
Copy code
"scripts": {
  "start": "node app.js",
  "dev": "nodemon app.js"
}
Now run with:

bash
Copy code
